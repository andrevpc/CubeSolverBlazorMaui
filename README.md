# CubeSolverBlazorMaui

This Blazor Project has the main goal of helping the user to solve a Rubik's cube (initially 3x3x3 and 2x2x2).

With intuitive visuals and a very simplistic approach, the software can aid in learning how to solve the puzzle or even just solving it while blindly following the instructions given.
As a group, all of our members had never messed with Blazor before (only had some background experience in C#), so it's proven to be kind of a challenge to us!

The application has easy to select modes of operation, checks for input errors in the user side, and solves the cube with relative ease using the common layer method for the 3x3 and the Ortega method for the 2x2.

The raw solver application is mantained and probably more up to date at the repo https://github.com/PeterMontez/CubeSolver
